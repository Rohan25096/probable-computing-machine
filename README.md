This is just a starter project to machine learning.
This project predicts shoe size and shoe price based on a person's age and sex, using Linear Regression.
Age is a strong predictor of shoe size (correlation: 0.87).
Shoe size has a weak correlation with price (0.33).
Sex does not significantly impact shoe price or size.
